<h1>Who are we</h1>
</div>

<main class="page">
<p>We at <b>GreenTools</b> aspire to be everyone's economic and ecologic companion. We champion the sharing economy and live according to a simple rule. It is far better to share the tools you own instead of owning more tools. Green Tools exists because <b>life is more than just about owning</b> more things.</p>
<p>The business idea sproutet in 2017 from a rather practical problem. Moving to suburbs brought a house and a yeard to take care of, and a number of other things to consider. As a new home owner, there was a lawn mover to be purchased, circular saw for building a patio, wheelbarrows to move the soil, concrete mixing tools, trash bins and many others. Next thing you know is that you need a toolshed for all the things you own. More space was required and the dream of a small house with a compact garden begun to materialize quite literally.</p>
<p>It took few years to refine the business model but around 2023 at the Turku University of Applied Sciences' business course ideas begun to collide and take shape. What was first a half serious project slowly turned into actionable plans. <b>GreenTools</b> ltd. was founded in 2024.</p>
<p>We at <b>GreenTools</b> are convinced that the current Mega Trends will shape our future through circular economy and distribution of agencies. Circualr economy will be vital for everyone from gen-Z and beyond. Circular economy will become a commong way to generate wealth. Ecological business becomes a cornerstone in which everyone can join.</p>
<p>We know that we are a small player in the vast sea of environmentally conscious businesses. But one thing is for sure. Every small step towards <b>the freedom to choose nature rather than wasting its resources</b> is worth taking. It will make the next generations stronger and the world a better place to live.</p>
