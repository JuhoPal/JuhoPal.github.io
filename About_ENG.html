<p>We at <b>GreenTools</b> aspire to be the companion for everyone who live economically and ecologically. We champion sharing economy and we live according to our motto: It is better to share the tools you own with your community instead of owning more tools. Green Tools exists because <b>life is so more than just about owning.</b></p>
<p>The business idea sproutet in 2017 from a rather practical problem. Moving to suburbs brought a house and a yeard to take care of and a number of other things to consider as a home owner. There was a lawn mover to be purchased, circular saw for making a patio, wheelbarrows, concrete mixing tools, trash bins and so many others. Next thing one might come up with was a toolshed. More space was required even though the family size was not growing. The dream started to materialize quite literally.</p>
<p>It took few years to refine the business model and around 2023 in the Turku Univ. of Appl. Sci. ICT business course the ideas begun to collide. A half serious project got a form in actionable plans. <b>Green Tools</b> ltd. was founded in 2024.</p>
<p>We at Green Tools are convinced that the current Mega Trends will shape e-business and business in general through circular economy and distribution of agencies. Circualr econnomy will be vital beyond gen-Z and a way of generating wealth. We march steadily towards environmentally thinking and respectful global society.</p>
<p>We know that we are a small player in the vast sea of environmentally conscious businesses. But one thing is for sure. Every small step towards <b>the freedom to choose nature rather than wasting its resources</b> is worth taking. It will make the next generations stronger and the world a better place to live. We can do this together.</p>
